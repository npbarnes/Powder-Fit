Powder-Fit
==========

A program for fitting NMR powder patterns.

Mostly intended as a programming exercise to help me learn Lua.
However, when it is done it will be useful for simulating and
fitting NMR spectra.

At this time I only intend to support static solid state boron-10 NMR
of amorphous or polycrystalline samples, but it shouldn't be too hard
to extend to other systems.

Email me if you would like to support other features. Although, I suggest
that you wait until I release v1.0.
